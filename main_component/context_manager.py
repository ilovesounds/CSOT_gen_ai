def get_sqlite_chat_history(session_id: str = "default_session"):

    Returns a ChatMessageHistory object backed by SQLite.
    In a real app, session_id would typically be tied to a user session.
    The table `langchain_chat_history` is automatically created by ChatMessageHistory
    when using SQLite.
    """
    # Note: SQLiteSaver is an older concept. The recommended way is ChatMessageHistory
    # with a SQLite-backed KVDocstore or similar. For simplicity, we directly create conn
    # or rely on LangChain's implicit table creation for ChatMessageHistory with SQLite.
    # The image mentioned SQLiteStore/SQLiteSaver. This is how you'd typically manage chat messages.
    
    # This directly creates a sqlite-backed history.
    # It requires the 'langchain-community' package.
    # The table 'langchain_chat_history' will be created automatically.
    
    # This is a conceptual representation. The `SQLiteSaver` or `SQLiteStore`
    # for arbitrary data often involves creating your own tables and explicit CRUD operations.
    # For *chat messages*, ChatMessageHistory provides a managed way.
    
    # As per LangChain docs, for persistent chat history, use KVDocstore or BaseChatMessageHistory implementation.
    # The closest to `SQLiteSaver` in modern LangChain for messages is often a custom setup
    # or using a built-in integration that handles persistence.
    
    # For demonstration, let's assume a simplified direct append to a conceptual history table
    # handled by the `create_database.py`'s `chat_history` table.
    # This `get_sqlite_chat_history` is more illustrative of how LangChain `ChatMessageHistory`
    # would connect to a DB for messages if you were using specific integrations,
    # but for your existing `chat_history` table, direct inserts are already in `week_4.py`.
    
    # Let's consider this function as a placeholder for how you'd initialize a LangChain
    # conversational memory buffer that internally saves to SQLite.
    # For the exact `SQLiteSaver` (if it refers to a generic state store), it's more involved.
    
    # For your current `chat_history` table, the saving logic is directly in `week_4.py`.
    # This section just clarifies the `SQLiteStore` / `SQLiteSaver` mention from the image
    # in the context of conversational messages.
